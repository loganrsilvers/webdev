<p>The way I read it, the article talks a lot about the concept of the "self-eating internet," where the new internet capitalizes on nostalgia for the old internet while erasing its essence. I think this is an interesting concept and one that I can relate to. I have watched the internet growing up and I can relate to the author when she writes <i>"The thrill of making and discovering sites is not the same. The analogue organicism of finding something is no longer there—these were sites you 'stumbled upon.'"</i> I think that because we are in a content consumption era of the internet that there no longer is any sense of originality online. Everyone is creating content for other people to look at and are looking at other people's content that they put out into the world. I know that on average everyone has made 1-3 posts per week and have contributed to making the internet larger every day. Additionally I know that me and my peers spend on average maybe around 5-6 hours of screen time exploring new content. I think it is interesting how the author highlights that everything we see has been seen before, and that there isn't anything new on the internet.</p>

<p>Adding on to this train of thought, Wagner writes that <b>"In the age of smartphones and apps, our agency is only more limited; even what we see is limited, restricted by the proprietary designs of a small handful of companies."</b> According to the article, I believe this to be true because even though in the previous paragraph I stated that most content is created by a mass amount of normal everyday average users and consumed by the same, they don't have the funding or resources to purchase ad space, as a matter of fact most people who use the internet have no need or desire to sell something to you, they mostly use the internet to find the things that they need or to pass the time. Wagner states that for the specific companies that control what were seeing on the internet, are able to do so because "These companies and platforms operate in part by devouring, appropriating, monetizing, exterminating, or burying on the 112th page of search results anything on the web that is even remotely interesting—especially anything amateur, anything ad hoc-ist." Companies buy internet space and use it to sell you something; product, lifestyle, etc. Wagner writes that there will pretty much never be an era where what were seeing on the internet is stuff that we as users are putting out for each other to see, and all of our feeds, tv, etc are flooded with content that companies feed us to keep us on the platforms. </p>

<p>As an example the Author continuously brings up MySpace. Wagner writes that "MySpace's demise marked the end of an era of personalization and creativity on the internet, replaced by the conformity of today's social media giants…MySpace offered a level of personalization and creativity that today’s social media platforms don’t even come close to." On MySpace, users follow the philosophy that I listed in the first paragraph where they create content that expresses their interests and connects with others, and they consume content that other people created because it's about sharing your stories and experiences. MySpace did not follow the format that other platforms like TikTok, Instagram, or Facebook are using where you are under the impression that what you’re seeing is who you are following but it's actually a combination of the people you follow and a recommendation of interests that you might have. </p>
